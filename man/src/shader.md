# Fragment Shader

Degenerate programs are written in JavaScript, and run on a WebWorker, but
rendering is performed using a WebGL instance in the main browser thread. The
fragment shader is reproduced below.

See the [same file on GitHub](https://github.com/casey/degenerate/blob/master/src/fragment.glsl) for
syntax highlighting.
